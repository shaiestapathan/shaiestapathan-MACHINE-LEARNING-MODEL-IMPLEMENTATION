DESCRIPTION:

Spam Email Classifier
This project is made for Task 4 of the CodTech Python Internship. The goal was to create a machine learning model using Python that can tell if a message is spam or not spam.

ðŸ§ª What I Did:
I used a dataset of SMS messages (some spam, some not).
I cleaned the text data by:
Removing special characters
Converting text to lowercase
Removing stopwords (common words like "the", "is", etc.)
I used TF-IDF Vectorization to convert the messages into numbers that a machine learning model can understand.
I used Logistic Regression to train the spam detection model.

ðŸ“Š Results:
The model was able to predict spam messages with high accuracy.
I tested it with both spam and ham (non-spam) messages, and it gave correct results

ðŸ’¡ What I Learned:
How to clean and prepare text data
How to use Scikit-learn for training a machine learning model
How to test and evaluate a model using accuracy score, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

ðŸ§  Tools Used:
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for chart)
Jupyter Notebook

This task helped me understand how text classification works and how machine learning can be used in real-life applications like email filtering.
